# Description
This repository contains the code for the etl4fairdata_AIC project. 
The project aims to develop a pipeline to extract, transform, and load data from different sources 
to a FAIR genomic ecosystem. The final goal is to create the files that will enable the
deployement of a Beacon (json files for the BeaconFriendlyFormat for mongoDB) and the deployement 
of a SPARQL endpoint (rdf files of aggregate genomic data). 
The pipeline is developed using the Snakemake workflow management system.

# About my input files 
QCed.VEP.AFctrls.GND.CADD.bcf 
- has positions with genotypes that are all reference like
- has samples that are not in the phenotype file
- has samples that are a merge of two samples in the phenotype file
signaled like sample1_sample2. These need to be eliminated as this is
contamination.
