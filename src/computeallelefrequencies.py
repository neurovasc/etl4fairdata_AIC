# This script takes in phenotypic data for AIC patients
# and corresponding genotypes from the VCF file.
# The genotypes are in 0/1 format after a bcftools query. 
# This script create a new df for each variation, and concatenates it
# to the phenotypic data csv/df. Then it computes the allele frequencies
# according to different features.
